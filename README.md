### Introduction

Office Sports is an app where users can challenge colleagues to either a foosball or a table tennis match. Using the app, players can register match results and view the scoreboard as well as recent matches.

### Technical Details

The app is written in Swift 5 and all UI is built programmatically. Screens will gradually be refactored to SwiftUI. Firebase (Firestore) is used as the backend and users sign in using their Google accounts. An MVVM (model-view-viewmodel) architecture is used for structring the code.

### Dependencies

SPM (Swift Package Manager) is used for dependency management. Currently, the only dependency is the Firebase iOS SDK.
